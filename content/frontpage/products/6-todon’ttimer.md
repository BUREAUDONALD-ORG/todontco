# To&#8203;Don’t&#8203;Timer

## Process Timer<br/>for Creative People

The process that makes an idea into a final product can take almost any amount of time: from 3 days to 3 months or even 3 years. What if you had a way to test the viability of your idea in just 3 minutes?

Use the ToDon’tTimer to sketch and test your ideas in a limited timeframe. In 3 minutes, you sketch a few options, pick one, and ‘finalize’ it as much as you can. Does that seem too short a timeframe? Try it first and see what you come up with. The end result of such a 3-minute round could easily be a clear sketch or small mock-up.

The result of this 3-minute test will help you decide whether you should spend more time developing your idea, or whether you should put it on your ToDon'tList.

You can use the ToDon’tTimer for all your creative processes. The ToDon’tTimer is also an interesting addition to Don’t/Do This – Game.
