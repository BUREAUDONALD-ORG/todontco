# To&#8203;Don’t&#8203;List

## Project Planning<br/>for Creative People

The ToDon’tList project planner makes it easier than ever to focus on your goals.

How do you decide what you will do today – and what you won't do? There simply isn't time to realise every brilliant idea and to execute every little task. And as we cannot create extra time, we need to make choices.

The ToDon'tList helps you make those choices, whether they concern your daily tasks, your new projects or even your professional or creative life. It gives you the gift of simplicity: just make a list for your life/work/project/year/month/day and throw out everything after the 3rd item. It will give you time and focus.
