# Don’t<strong>/</strong>Do<br>This <strong>Game</strong>

## Thought Experiments<br>for Creative People

Whatever kind of creative person you are, this thought experiment game will get you out of your comfort zone. How? It stimulates creativity through limitations.

#### How to play

Take 3 Do cards. These define the guidelines to your next unique imaginary project. But you also get 3 Don’t cards, which give you a set of limitations.

Once you start playing, you will see that limitations also give you possibilities. That’s exactly how you end up with unexpected and extraordinary ideas.

Play this game alone, together or in groups — for fun, to break the ice in a meeting or to get inspired when you're stuck.
