# Work Don’t Shop

## Productivity Workshop<br/>for Creative People

Work Don’t Shop is a great ice-breaker for conferences and events. It can be tailored to different groups, from corporate organizations to art students – whether they are in a ‘creative’ industry or not.

#### Workshop

During the workshop, you will write, talk and sketch according to the **ToDon’tList** method: make choices, do less, but do it better. You will work alone as well as in teams. Take what works for you.

The first part of the workshop will offer straightforward exercises that reveal who, what and where you want to be in a matter of minutes. By making the right choices, you not only gain focus in your life but also your work and projects. What is important? What do you do and what do you not do? How do you stay away from side paths?

The second part of the workshop — the game — shows what you can do creatively; how you can find solutions to seemingly unsolvable problems long before the deadline. The game forces you to get out of your comfort zone. The imposed limitations and rules of the game stimulate creativity like you wouldn’t believe. Find the “Loopholes”.

This workshop of about 120 minutes works well for groups up to 50 people. We offer alternative formats for specific events. \
Price starts at € 950,- excl VAT and travel costs.
